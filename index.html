                <h1>Dawen Otsutsuki (Not Senju)</h1>
                <p>Boyo, aka daw joined in the new Strike after the first nuke in Jan, during that period I was still serving the village as the First Strikage and if I am not wrong, the village was in the process of electing the new kage. Things were tense between the Hidden Strike Village and the Onyx/Ghost Village. Daw was jumped on by many people from the Onyx/Ghost when he was just trying to help newbies with the scrolls. After I took revenge for my boyo, I decided to leave the village on May 8th, 2019.  After my farewell, I started using the account name LyndaBarn in order to fix some things in Strike in a confidential manner. That's when I really met boyo, I tested him and he became one of my favourite people ever :D. Boyo is the epitome for a perfect being and I shall stand by these words forever. He's awesome, he's kind, he's wise, he cares, he just always make me proud. More than any of this, boyo taught me a lesson, he taught me that no matter how things maybe, one should never stop being nice. I am proud of you boyo.</p>

                <h1>Time with boyo</h1>
                <p>   I secretly started to train boyo as LyndaBarn. We used to train everyday in Ranked matches. Those were few best days of my Beyond Journey. We both tried our very best to get better every single day. He was a quick learner, he came over his weaknesses and we used to do it together. Apart from Beyond training, my main goal was to train Boyo to be a good leader/kage. I am vouch that he's kept up with my thoughts for him, he's developing a new skill every day and he's consistent at whatever he does. Once again boyo, I am proud of you and I wish you have a really great New Year :DDDDDD</p>

                <p> Kwi/Z/Artzii/Potatopie/kiwi/whatever, I met him/her in September while he/she was with Hallow. At that time me and Hallow were 2 of the most popular (well, still are) people of Beyond. This guy/girl had a byakungan and I thought he/she was Ness or some random HyuGAY alt. As usual I started off with being toxic until Hallow started training him/her. Eventually I accepted KWI and traced him/her on Discord so that Hallow can train him/her even better. After a few months of him/her training with hallow, I got really close to KWI. I started speaking to KWI on a regular basis and we became really close friends. In December Kwi became my daughter (or son idrk what to say) after me and some random Beyond girl got "married" * skull_emoji *.</p>

In Jan of 2019 you literally surprised me by buying 400+ Robux on my account, it was the best surprise ever :D. Not to mention, whenever I felt low or was worried about some random crap (ykw) you always used to listen to me and help me out, you're da best man alive. In September, if it weren't you, I would prolly never have become what I am rn. You changed my life nigga, you did. I owe you so much, it's something that's nearly impossible to repay cuz you did a big task of influencing my life with your presence. I shall always be there to hear to you whenever you need my help, I shall always provide you with the support you need whenever there's anything wrong happening to ya. You can trust me bud. I wish you a Very Happy New Year :D</p>

                <p> Haha, as I am writing this I realize there's A LOT I can write about us. Actually, I could write a whole fucking book about us and it'd actually cool when you think about it. Anyways, I met Hallow in late January 2019 in forest mode. I was a C-rank and I could see the chat go "omg the goddess is here". I was so confused and new to forest at that time. I remember going onto the Top Scroll and seeing a Beyond avatar (Hallow) with her unique pink hair and butterfly mode on taking on a bunch of people at once. I never had gotten that feeling (I can't describe it), but it felt like I actually was looking a fuckin Goddess. I was new at that time and to me a girl soloing about 5-6 people is something really new. I would say I was flattered. I decided that I would get strong enough to beat that person, POW * she killed me then *. AGHHH I would describe everything what happened after that and how we got close, etc etc. But I'ma definitely write about Heavy Weight Champion. I got close to Hallow as I started calling her fat indirectly. Now that I realize, I was unknowingly flirting with Hallow, wtf. Anyways yeah, HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPION.</p>

                <p>  Me and Hallow have a really long history together, a history of nearly 2 years. She is prolly the first girl to have gotten really close to me ever in my life, and I am surprised someone online was able to gain those high ranks with me. No matter what I say, I am glad that I met ya, you've influenced a lot of stuffs in my personality. I have learnt a lot of stuffs about girls from ya xD. You've tried really hard to improve my drip, but smh I don't think I could get any better than what I am xDDDD. Not to mention, we both have had each other's back whenever we needed each other. We have fought so many times, A LOT of times and yet we never really got away from each other. Well yeah, we don't speak much to each other as I am kinda away but I hope we'll always be friends like we ever was. I'ma end it with "Nigga" (if you know, you know). I wish you a Very Happy New Year and thanks for always being there for me whenever I needed you.</p>

Strike war'd with Phantom,Mform,galaxywhite a lot they use to target me and jump me a lot because I use to be apart of their group and left. Over time beta started getting more boring by the day. Then after a while of doing Beyond Beta wars and a while with players coming and going and some people retiring then Shinobi Life 2 came out. I wasn't really used to Shinobi Life 2 then I got use to it from leveling PvPing and playing the game. Later on during SL2 I became sub-kage of Strike while kenny was kage.I climbed up the ranks pretty quick and did well while doing so. Now we are still in a Shinobi life age.</p>

                        <p>I joined in early May this year, when I first joined I didn't talk much because I felt I didn't fit in with anyone in Strike. The only person I could bring myself to talk to was wolf because he invited me to strike. When I first joined Strike, I was a tai spammer in beta, I made lots of one shot combos with like 5 tai. When I noticed that a lot of the more respected players used 1 or 2 tai combos, I started to do so as well. I started to rank up quickly in Strike, becoming a full-fledged Jonin in about a month or so and later on, Head Examiner. In Late July/early August, I ended up going very inactive because I started playing another game where I was an HR for one of the factions. I stopped playing the game around the start of September and came back to Beyond whilst in wait for SL2. Once SL2 came out i played it alot and came back to this community. Now, I have been able to rank up to Daimyo. Currently I'm very busy with irl issues and I don't enjoy roblox like I used to and I haven't played a single roblox game in around a week.
